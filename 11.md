# Research Project 11: Proxy
## I. What Is Proxy ?
Assumed that you have a computer system in your organization that being used by two type of users. One of them is employees (aka Users) which have limited access to some of the functions on the system. The others one is Managers (aka Admins) which have all access to Users functions as well of some of the function that only them allowed to run.

The easy solution for this problem in OOP would be using Inheritance:<br><br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunghieumickey/team12-hcmus-research-project/main/11/naive.png)
```c++
class User{
	protected:
		string someData;
	public:
		void UserFunction(){
			cout << "UserFunction";
		}
};

class Admin : public User{
	public:
		void AdminFuction(){
			cout << "AdminFuction";
		}
};
```

But this does come up with a few problems. One of them is that a User pointer couldn't be contain an admin very well in case your app also have to support an Admin to run their functions
```c++
User *Joe = new Admin;
Joe->AdminFunction();
```
```
Error: no member named 'AdminFunction' in 'User'
```
Even if you somehow work around that (like using interpreter programing language). It would still halt when Users try to run Admin only functions and it could breakdown the whole system. It would be way better if the program is responded to the Users that they can't run Admin function but still effective at protecting the system from being exploits from Users.
### Introducing Proxy
Proxy means ‘in place of’, representing’ or ‘in place of’ or ‘on behalf of’ are literal meanings of proxy and that directly explains Proxy Design Pattern.
Proxies are also called surrogates, handles, and wrappers. They are closely related in structure, but not purpose, to Adapters and Decorators.

A real world example can be a cheque or credit card is a proxy for what is in our bank account. It can be used in place of cash, and provides a means of accessing that cash when required. And that’s exactly what the Proxy pattern does – “Controls and manage access to the object they are protecting“.

Now, let return to our problem at the begining, since proxy can be used to manage access to objects. Using **Protection Proxy** might help us solve this problem.<br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunghieumickey/team12-hcmus-research-project/main/11/Protection.png)

```c++
struct UserService{
	virtual void UserFunction() = 0;
	virtual void AdminFunction() = 0;
};

struct Admin : public UserService{
	void UserFunction(){
		cout << "UserFunction";
	}
	void AdminFunction(){
		cout << "AdminFunction";
	}
};

class User : public UserService{
	private:
		string role;
		Admin *elevated;
	public:

		User(string role){
			this->role = role;
			if(role == "Admin"){
				elevated = new Admin();
			}
		}

		void UserFunction(){
			cout << "UserFunction";
		}

		void AdminFunction(){
			if (role == "Admin"){
				elevated->AdminFunction();
			}
			else{
				cerr << "You are not Admin";
			}
		}
};
```
