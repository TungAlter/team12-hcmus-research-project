# Research Project 12: Adapter 
## I. What Is Adapter ?
Suppose we got an library that define how a bird should be worked.
```c++
class Bird { 
  public: 
     void Fly() { 
          cout << "Flying" << endl; 
      } 
      void Sing() { 
          cout << "Chirp Chirp" << endl; 
      } 
      void Eat() { 
          cout << "Eating" <<endl; 
      } 
      void Sleep() { 
          cout << "Sleeping" << endl; 
      } 
}; 
```
Imagine that you're a developer that works for a toymaker company. You're required to create a toy duck that make sound exactly like a bird when being squeak using the above library. An easy solution to deal with this problem is to make the toy duck inheritance from the bird so that the toy duck can sing like a bird.<br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunghieumickey/team12-hcmus-research-project/main/12/naive.png)
```c++
class PlasticToyDuck : public Bird { 
  public:
    void Squeak(){
      Sing();
    }
}; 
```
Now your toy should be sing like a bird when we squeak it.
```c++
int main() {
  PlasticToyDuck NewToy;
  NewToy.Squeak()
  return 0;
}
```
```
Chirp Chirp
```
But now there are a lot of problems that arises here. <br>
Though the toy duck can sing as the we wants, the toy duck is now like a bird than a toy duck. Because it also can eat, sleep, and fly. They are not the methods that the we wanted. We just wants the toy duck can sing not also eat, fly and sleep.
```c++
int main() {
  PlasticToyDuck NewToy;
  NewToy.Fly()
  NewToy.Eat()
  NewToy.Sleep()
  return 0;
}
```
```
Flying
Eating
Sleeping
```
And besides the mentioned problem above, when the we wants our toy duck can do one more thing such as barking like a dog. We will have to make the toy duck inheritance from the dog besides inheritance from the bird. It will lead to multi-inheritance and the toy duck is now either look like a bird, a dog, or a toy duck. Multi-inheritance is very complicated and it not guaranteed to be supported by many programming languages. So we need an easier solution to dealt with this problem.
