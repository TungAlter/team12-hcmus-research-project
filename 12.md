# Research Project 12: Adapter 
## I. What Is Adapter ?
Suppose we got an library that define how a bird should be worked.
```c++
class Bird { 
  public: 
     void Fly() { 
          cout << "Flying" << endl; 
      } 
      void Sing() { 
          cout << "Chirp Chirp" << endl; 
      } 
      void Eat() { 
          cout << "Eating" <<endl; 
      } 
      void Sleep() { 
          cout << "Sleeping" << endl; 
      } 
}; 
```
Imagine that you're a developer that works for a toymaker company. You're required to create a toy duck that make sound exactly like a bird when being squeak using the above library. An easy solution to deal with this problem is to make the toy duck inheritance from the bird so that the toy duck can sing like a bird.<br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunghieumickey/team12-hcmus-research-project/main/12/naive.png)
```c++
class PlasticToyDuck : public Bird { 
  public:
    void Squeak(){
      Sing();
    }
}; 
```
Now your toy should be sing like a bird when we squeak it.
```c++
int main() {
  PlasticToyDuck NewToy;
  NewToy.Squeak()
  return 0;
}
```
```
Chirp Chirp
```
But now there are a lot of problems that arises here. <br>
Though the toy duck can sing as the we wants, the toy duck is now like a bird than a toy duck. Because it also can eat, sleep, and fly. They are not the methods that the we wanted. We just wants the toy duck can sing not also eat, fly and sleep.
```c++
int main() {
  PlasticToyDuck NewToy;
  NewToy.Fly()
  NewToy.Eat()
  NewToy.Sleep()
  return 0;
}
```
```
Flying
Eating
Sleeping
```
And besides the mentioned problem above, when the we wants our toy duck can do one more thing such as barking like a dog. We will have to make the toy duck inheritance from the dog besides inheritance from the bird. It will lead to multi-inheritance and the toy duck is now either look like a bird, a dog, or a toy duck. Multi-inheritance is very complicated and it not guaranteed to be supported by many programming languages. So we need an easier solution to dealt with this problem.

### Introduction to Adapter
Adapter is one of 23 design pattern, but before we learn more about adapter in programming, we should take a look about the existence of them in real life. Let’s see this example.<br>
If you ever needed to use a US-made laptop in a European country ? Then you have probably needed an AC power adapter. Because the input of the Laptop plug is 220V, but the power outlet of the AC is 110V. So you need to have a adapter that can convert the 110V to 220V, and also shape the power plug to correct shape.<br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunghieumickey/team12-hcmus-research-project/main/12/WallAdapter.png)<br>
Now you know what the adapter does: it sits in between the plug of your laptop and the European AC outlet, its job is to adapt the European outlet so that you can plug your laptop into it and receive the power properly. Or look at this way: the adapter changes the interface of the outlet into one that your laptop expects. That is also the role of the adapter pattern playing in programing. The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interface. Here is the diagram of the adapter pattern:<br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunghieumickey/team12-hcmus-research-project/main/12/AdapterDiagram.png)<br>

Now head back to the toy duck problem. We will now implement the adapter pattern we already know above by creating an adapter class called “BirdAdapter” which contains an instance of the adaptee class in this situation the adaptee is “Bird”.	The adapter will interact with the client and when it gets a method call it turns around and delegates the calls to the adaptee. Thanks to the adapter, the client will still interact with the interface of “ToyDuck” and the “Bird” will still get the call from the client though it has a different interface with “ToyDuck”.So that the client will have the expected toy duck without any redundant method.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunghieumickey/team12-hcmus-research-project/main/12/BirdAdapter.png)<br>

```c++
class ToyDuck {
  public:
      virtual void Squeak() = 0;
};

class PlasticToyDuck : public ToyDuck{
  public:
      void Squeak(){
          cout<<"Squeaking"<<endl;
      }
};

class BirdAdapter : public ToyDuck{
  private:
      Bird a;
  public:
      BirdAdapter(Bird a){
          this->a = a;
      }
      void Squeak(){
          a.Sing();
      }
};

```
Now we test it out if it works as expected.
```c++
int main() {
  Bird a;
  ToyDuck* NewToy = new BirdAdapter(a);
  NewToy->Squeak();
  return 0;
}
```

```
Chirp Chirp
```
```c++
int main() {
  Bird a;
  ToyDuck* NewToy = new BirdAdapter(a);
  NewToy->Fly();
  return 0;
}
```
```
Error: no member named 'Fly' in 'ToyDuck'
```
So we can see that the client can still interact with the interface of “ToyDuck” while the “Bird” are completely separate from the “ToyDuck”. It does work as expected.

## II. When we should using Adapter ?
Suppose we have a class that has a method that we want to call but it is not defined in the class. We can use the adapter partern to solve that problem. But sometimes, Adapter is not the right answer to solve the problem especially when the the drawback is way bigger than the advantage it gave you.
### Advantages 

- It lets classes and interfaces work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces 

- It allows for greater code reusability and code flexibility

### Drawbacks

- Code can become too complex as the adapter pattern requires the introduction of new classes and interfaces. 

- Sometimes many adaptions are required along an adapter chain to reach the type which is require (more complicated). 
  
In conclusion, Adapter is a good solution if your problem is not too complex and you want to reuse the code of the class you are adapting. If the problem is too complex, you should use the Decorator pattern instead.

Here is a real world example of where the Adapter pattern should be used. Imagine you have a service which returns weather (in celsius) by passing city name as a input value. Now, assume that your client wants to pass zipcode as input and expecting the temperature of the city in return. Here you will need an adaptor to achieve this.<br>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trunghieumickey/team12-hcmus-research-project/main/12/Weather.png)<br>
```c++
class WeatherFinder
{
public:
    double getTemperature(string cityName)
    {
        return 40; // Example
    }
};

class WeatherFinderClient
{
public:
    virtual double getTemperature(string zipcode) = 0;
};

class WeatherAdapter : public WeatherFinderClient
{
public:
    double getTemperature(string zipcode)
    {
        string cityName = getCityName(zipcode);
        WeatherFinder temp;
        return temp.getTemperature(cityName);
    }
    string getCityName(string zipCode)
    {
        return "Ho Chi Minh city"; // Example
    }
};
```
